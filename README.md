# walkntalk
 
WalkNtalk is an Android application that aims to enable users to meet like-minded people while participating in an active lifestyle. In addition, what makes our app unique is that it allows users to create their own events surrounding a theme or subject for others to join, creating a common topic for event-goers to conversate about. Furthermore, the app communicates with the Gemini API to generate starter questions to get the conversation going. 

This project is created for my Software Engineering class (SC2006).

## Installation instructions:
